I always sucked at frontend. Every single time I decided to create some website, I would end up with a horrendous looking frontpage. But I would always blame my non-existent designing skills. I'd say "hey, I'm a dev, not a designer, if I would use a component library my website's frontend would instantly be good!". But I did not bother using a component library because either I was lazy of though it was a crutch and that I should learn to use CSS or Tailwind (both are quite dumb reasons now looking back).

But recently I started a new project and decided that I could not be bothered to write CSS, so for the first time I used a component library. And thats when I realised - not only do I suck at design, I also suck at frontend development. For the first time I realised, that frontend is more that just design. Making the whole page responsive is a big hassle for which the developer is fully responsible. My website did look better because of the component library, but it did not look no where near "good".

Anyway, now not only do I know where I have to put in more work to learn and get better, but I have also gained more appreciation for frontend developers.
